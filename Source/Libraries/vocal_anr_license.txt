        remain in full force and effect. The waiver of one breach or default or delay in exercising any rights shall not 
        constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. All notices permitted or required under this Agreement 
        shall be in writing and shall be mailed by first class, registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, 
        to the address of the Party specified in this Agreement or such other address as either Party may specify in writing.
